# Doors and Windows
While doors and windows are theoretically possible in Atlas already thanks to MeatKit,
Atlas does not come with any example prefabs for them yet. This is because the door and
window systems are not yet finalized in the vanilla game and the examples for using them
will not be added until that is the case. This page will be updated as more information
becomes available.
