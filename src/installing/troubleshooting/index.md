Read through this guide from top to bottom and follow the steps within to narrow down what is causing the issue and what
potential fixes you may have.

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assumes you are using r2modman / Thunderstore Mod Manager.

## None of my mods are working / the game doesn't open

Make sure that a console window is opening up on your desktop alongside the game when you start the game modded. If one
does not then it is highly likely that your issue is with r2modman and you should read
their [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/wiki/Why-aren%27t-my-mods-working%3F).

### [x mod] depends on y, but it is not installed

Log error:

```log
[Fatal :    Deli] Mod [Melons Mags 0.1.0] depends on h3vr.otherloader.deli @ 0.2.0, but it is not installed
[Fatal : BepInEx] Could not run preloader!
```

This message will appear when you have Otherloader 1.0.0 installed, but
not [Deliter](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Stratum/Deliter/). Since Otherloader now uses stratum, it is not deli
compliant. Install [Deliter](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Stratum/Deliter/) and it will convert your deli mods
to stratum mods.

Potential fixes:

1. Install [Deliter](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Stratum/Deliter/).

... or ...

1. Downgrade Otherloader:
    1. Go to the `Online` section.
    2. Download Otherloader.
    3. Select `0.3` as the version.

This can also happen when you have outdated or mods that aren't installed.

* You have a mod X that requires Y to also be installed but it is outdated or missing. If the mod is installed, update
  it, and if not, install it.

## Only some of my mods are working

First, please ensure you are running the latest version of the game and all your installed mods. It's important
everything is up to date as that is the first thing you will be told to do if you can't solve your issue and decide ask
for help. It's also possible that some mods require you to be running on the alpha branch, in which case you can also
try opting in or out to see if that solves your issue.

Next, check the [log / log file](log_file.md) for errors and warnings. Often it will point out right away what the exact
issue is and what mod is causing it. Below you can find some of the most common errors, but once you've discovered which
mod is having issues you can select its article from further down to get more specific troubleshooting steps.

### Outdated game

Log errors:

```log
[Error  : Unity Log] ArgumentException: Undefined target method for patch method static bool TNHTweaker.Patches.TNHPatches::GenerateSentryPatrolPatch ...
[Error  : Unity Log] InvalidOperationException: Loader required for setup asset ...
```

... or ...

```log
[Warning:      Deli] Could not load all types from WurstMod, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral ...
[Error  : Unity Log] Exception: This version of the game is not supported. Please update your game.
```

Potential fixes:

* Update your game to the latest version. If it is already up to date, try restarting Steam and or your computer as
  sometimes it can fix the Steamworks API not initializing correctly and reporting the correct game version.

## A specific mod
