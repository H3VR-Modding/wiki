# Troubleshooting Wurstmod

Listed below are common errors / mistakes for WurstMod and custom maps.

## I have installed a custom map but I don't see it in-game.

Depending on the type of the map it can be found in two different places:

If it is a custom Take and Hold level it will be located on the vanilla level selection panel in the Take and Hold
Lobby (the room where you eat the hotdog to start a game of TNH). The panel between the settings and the leaderboard
will have arrows on it, cycle through until you reach the custom level and eat the hotdog as normal.

Custom sandbox scenes will be located in the main menu directly behind you when you load into the game. Just like with
the other vanilla scenes you must point at it and pull the trigger to select it, then head over to the panel and select
load just as you would with a normal vanilla scene.
